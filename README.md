# esp32-security-system
This project implements a security system with alarm using an ESP32. The system monitors the environment with a PIR sensor and, upon detecting movement, triggers a buzzer, a red LED, and displays an alert on the 0.96" OLED display. Optionally, it can send notifications to Telegram.
